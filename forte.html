                                            I have loved <a>coding</a> and <a>mathematics</a> for as long as I can remember. Since starting coding in <a>python</a>, I began
                                            learning more advanced coding languages such as <a>C++</a> and <a>C#</a>. <br><br>I learnt to use <a>HTML</a>,
                                            <a>CSS</a> and <a>JS</a> to start creating websites. However, for this website, 
                                            I also learnt how to code in <a>Svelte</a>.
                                        </p>

                                        This year was good for me in terms of my Robotics. I joined the Robotics@apex CCA and competed 
                                        in IDE robotics, where I got 7th place. While it was relatively low (to me, at least), I enjoyed 
                                        the stress and competition involved in the competition. In SSTInc, I completed an Intro to React 
                                        course, which enhanced my familiarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript while learning about ReactJS. 
                                        Lastly, this year saw me start developing a shooter game using unity, which is currently under 
                                        development.
                                    </p>
                                    <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;" class = "sto-list">
                                        <p style = "color:white; font-size:10vh;">2021</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>
                                        This year I did not spend too much time actually coding or playing with my robots in 
                                        preparation for PSLE, but I did re-think the names. Now the EV3 is Eve, the Mbot is 
                                        The Enterprise, Cue is Dash, and my Sphero is Ball. I redesigned my website and created 
                                        keyloggers and password-cracking software on python. 
                                        I also learnt how to use Virtual Machines on VMware Fusion, and 
                                        created a local windows machine for use at home.
                                    </p>
                                    <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;" class = "sto-list">

                                    <p>
                                        This year, I started weekly classes for principles 4, and 5. I learnt 
                                        Hypertext markup language, JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets to build 
                                        and design websites, like my first <a href="github.com/yaushing/dsa">personal website</a> 
                                        hosted on my GitHub. I learnt to create visual games using python and started using 
                                        Construct 3 to easily build visual games. In my CCA, we learnt to use drones and program them 
                                        with swift.
                                    </p>

                                        This year is when I got even more robots: the Cue robot and the Sphero robot. 
                                        I extremely enjoyed them as I developed my passion for more robotics and coding. 
                                        In my CCA, I started Minecraft Education Edition in school and found a way to both 
                                        play a game and code at the same time. I joined boot camps for Principles 1, 2, and 3 
                                        in <a href="https://www.sgcodecampus.com/">SG code campus</a> and started giving my robots names. 
                                    </p>
                                    <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center;" class = "sto-list">

                                    <p>
                                        In this year, I joined the Info-comm club in primary school and started coding 
                                        as a full hobby. I learnt how to use the Makeblock's most simple robot, the Mbot, 
                                        in school. I also got my second robot, the Makeblock Ultimate 2.0, and joined a 
                                        course at First Code Academy to learn how to use more complex controls for the Mbot.
                                    </p>

                                        I believe this is when I started coding at Camp Asia as a holiday bootcamp, 
                                        where I was first introduced to Scratch and the whole world of coding. This is 
                                        also the year I went to First Code Academy at the end of the year to learn Minecraft 
                                        Modding and 3D design. I got my first robot in this year, EV3.

                                          I have been fascinated by <a>numbers</a> and their rules and orders since young, 
                                          yet it has never occurred to me that <a>Math Olympiad</a> is a path I would ever venture 
                                          down. It was in 2019 that I tried it on a whim, and it was <a>thrilling</a>. The 
                                          move for online competition in 2020 posed multiple challenges, such as having to do things online.
                                          However, by far, 
                                          <a>SIMOC</a> was my favourite 
                                          as I met many like-minded kids worldwide.

                                        I took a break from Math Olympiads this year to get used to my new schedule 
                                        in school. I had to also stop Math Classroom as the class time coincided with 
                                        my CCA. However, I decided that next year I would join Math Olympiads.

                                        This year, I only participated in SASMO. However, I got Gold, 
                                        which was my highest ever. I only participated in one as I had a lot of 
                                        stress from PSLE. However, I continued in my weekly classes to improve my 
                                        school grades and proudly managed to get high in my class.

                                        This year, I participated in SMKC, Mathlympics, SIMOC, SASMO and AMC. 
                                        My scores actually improved, and I gladly continued my classes at The 
                                        Math Classroom. My grades in school also increased, and my classes shifted 
                                        from Monday to Wednesday 2:30.

                                        This year I started joining Math Olympaids. I joined 
                                        Singapore Math Kangaroo Contest (SMKC), National Mathematical 
                                        Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS), Mathlympics 2019, Singapore and 
                                        Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO), and Australian Math Competition (AMC). 
                                        While my scores were not that rousing, I enjoyed the experience and dedicated 
                                        myself to start doing better. I joined The Math Classroom under competition 
                                        math under Ms Tou, and almost immediately my grades increased.
